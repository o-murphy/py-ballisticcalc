# --- EXCEPTIONS: Un-ignore specific directories if their .c or .h files are source code ---
# The following lines explicitly tell Git NOT to ignore files within these specific directories.
# This assumes that 'py_ballisticcalc_exts/src/' contains your source .c files (like v3d.c)
# and 'py_ballisticcalc_exts/include/' contains your source .h files (like v3d.h)
# that you DO want to track in Git.

# Un-ignore the 'src' directory within py_ballisticcalc_exts
!py_ballisticcalc_exts/src/
# Un-ignore the 'include' directory within py_ballisticcalc_exts
!py_ballisticcalc_exts/include/
