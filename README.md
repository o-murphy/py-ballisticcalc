## Usage

The library supports all the popular units of measurement, and adds different built-in methods to define and manipulate it
#### Unit manipulation syntax:

```python
from py_ballisticcalc.unit import *

# ways to define value in units
# 1. old syntax
unit_in_meter = Distance(100, Distance.Meter)
# 2. short syntax by Unit type class
unit_in_meter = Distance.Meter(100)
# 3. by Unit enum class
unit_in_meter = Unit.METER(100)

# >>> <Distance>: 100.0 m (3937.0078740157483)

# convert unit
# 1. by method
unit_in_yard = unit_in_meter.convert(Distance.Yard)
# 2. using shift syntax
unit_in_yards = unit_in_meter << Distance.Yard  # '<<=' operator also supports
# >>> <Distance>: 109.36132983377078 yd (3937.0078740157483)

# get value in specified units
# 1. by method
value_in_km = unit_in_yards.get_in(Distance.Kilometer)
# 2. by shift syntax
value_in_km = unit_in_yards >> Distance.Kilometer  # '>>=' operator also supports
# >>> 0.1

# getting unit raw value:
rvalue = Distance.Meter(10).raw_value
rvalue = float(Distance.Meter(10))

# units comparison:
# supports operators like < > <= >= == !=
Distance.Meter(100) == Distance.Centimeter(100)  # >>> False, compare two units by raw value
Distance.Meter(100) > 10  # >>> True, compare unit with float by raw value
```

#### An example of calculations

```python
from py_ballisticcalc import Velocity, Temperature, Distance
from py_ballisticcalc import DragModel, TableG7
from py_ballisticcalc import Ammo, Atmo, Wind
from py_ballisticcalc import Weapon, Shot, Calculator
from py_ballisticcalc import Settings as Set


# set global library settings
Set.Units.velocity = Velocity.FPS
Set.Units.temperature = Temperature.Celsius
# Set.Units.distance = Distance.Meter
Set.Units.sight_height = Distance.Centimeter

Set.set_max_calc_step_size(Distance.Foot(1))
Set.USE_POWDER_SENSITIVITY = True  # enable muzzle velocity correction my powder temperature

# define params with default units
weight, diameter = 168, 0.308
# or define with specified units
length = Distance.Inch(1.282)  # length = Distance(1.282, Distance.Inch)

weapon = Weapon(9, 100, 2)
dm = DragModel(0.223, TableG7, weight, diameter)

ammo = Ammo(dm, length, 2750, 15)
ammo.calc_powder_sens(2723, 0)

zero_atmo = Atmo.icao(100)

# defining calculator instance
calc = Calculator(weapon, ammo, zero_atmo)

current_atmo = Atmo(110, 1000, 15, 72)
current_winds = [Wind(2, 90)]
shot = Shot(1500, atmo=current_atmo, winds=current_winds)

shot_result = calc.fire(shot, trajectory_step=Distance.Yard(100))

for p in shot_result:
    print(p.formatted())
```
#### Example of the formatted output:
```shell
python -m py_ballisticcalc.example
```

## About project

The library provides trajectory calculation for projectiles including for various
applications, including air rifles, bows, firearms, artillery and so on.

3DF model that is used in this calculator is rooted in old C sources of version 2 of the public version of JBM
calculator, ported to C#, optimized, fixed and extended with elements described in
Litz's "Applied Ballistics" book and from the friendly project of Alexandre Trofimov
and then ported to Go.

Now it's also ported to python3 and expanded to support calculation trajectory by 
multiple ballistics coefficients and using custom drag data (such as Doppler radar data Â©Lapua, etc.)

Go documentation can be obtained using godoc tool.

The current status of the project is ALPHA version.

#### RISK NOTICE

The library performs very limited simulation of a complex physical process and so it performs a lot of approximations. Therefore, the calculation results MUST NOT be considered as completely and reliably reflecting actual behavior or characteristics of projectiles. While these results may be used for educational purpose, they must NOT be considered as reliable for the areas where incorrect calculation may cause making a wrong decision, financial harm, or can put a human life at risk.
