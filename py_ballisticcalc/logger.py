"""Logging configuration and utilities for py_ballisticcalc library.

This module provides a centralized logging system for the py_ballisticcalc library,
including both console and optional file logging capabilities. The logger is configured
with appropriate formatters and can be dynamically adjusted for different logging needs.

The module exposes a pre-configured logger instance and utility functions for managing
file-based logging. By default, only console logging is enabled with INFO level,
but file logging can be enabled as needed for debugging or detailed analysis.

Global Variables:
    logger: Pre-configured logger instance for the library.
    file_handler: Global file handler reference (None when file logging disabled).

Functions:
    enable_file_logging: Enable logging to a file with DEBUG level.
    disable_file_logging: Disable file logging and clean up resources.

Example:
    Basic logging usage:
    ```python
    from py_ballisticcalc.logger import logger
    
    logger.info("Ballistic calculation started")
    logger.warning("Trajectory calculation ended before requested distance")
    logger.error("Unable to find angle to hit target")
    ```
    
    Enable file logging for debugging:
    ```python
    from py_ballisticcalc.logger import enable_file_logging, disable_file_logging
    
    # Enable detailed logging to file
    enable_file_logging("ballistics_debug.log")
    
    # Perform calculations with detailed logging
    # ... ballistic calculations ...
    
    # Clean up file logging
    disable_file_logging()
    ```

Note:
    The logger name 'py_balcalc' is used for historical compatibility.
    All log messages from the library components will be routed through this logger.

    """Enable logging to a file with DEBUG level output.

    This function configures file-based logging, replacing any existing file handler.
    File logging captures all DEBUG level messages and above with timestamp information,
    providing detailed logging for debugging and analysis purposes.

    Args:
        filename: Name of the log file to create. Defaults to "debug.log".
                 The file will be created in the current working directory
                 unless an absolute path is provided.
                 
    Note:
        If file logging is already enabled, the existing file handler will be
        removed and replaced with a new one using the specified filename.
        The file will be opened in append mode, so existing content is preserved.
        
    Example:
        ```python
        from py_ballisticcalc.logger import enable_file_logging, logger
        
        # Enable detailed file logging
