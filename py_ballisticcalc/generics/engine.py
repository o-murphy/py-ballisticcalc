"""Engine protocol module for py_ballisticcalc.

This module defines the EngineProtocol type protocol that all ballistic 
calculation engines must implement. The protocol specifies the interface
for integrating trajectories and finding zeroing angles, enabling 
interchangeable engine implementations throughout the library.

The EngineProtocol uses Python's typing.Protocol to define a structural
type that engine classes must conform to, ensuring consistent behavior
across different engine implementations while allowing for various
computational approaches and optimizations.

Classes:
    EngineProtocol: Type protocol for ballistic calculation engines

Type Variables:
    ConfigT: Configuration type for the engine (covariant)

Note:
    All engine implementations must provide both integrate() and zero_angle()
    methods with the exact signatures specified in this protocol to ensure
    compatibility with the Calculator interface and other library components.

    """Protocol defining the interface for ballistic trajectory calculation engines.

    This protocol outlines the methods that any concrete ballistic engine
    implementation should provide to perform trajectory calculations,
    retrieve drag model information, and determine zeroing angles for firearms.
    
    All engines implementing this protocol can be used interchangeably with
    the Calculator interface, enabling a modular architecture for different
    numerical integration methods and calculation approaches.

    Type Parameters:
        ConfigT: The configuration type used by this engine implementation.
                Must be covariant to support configuration inheritance.

    Required Methods:
        integrate: Perform ballistic trajectory calculation  
        zero_angle: Calculate zeroing angle for given distance

    Example:
        >>> from py_ballisticcalc.engines.base_engine import BaseEngineConfigDict
        >>> 
        >>> class MyEngine(EngineProtocol[BaseEngineConfigDict]):
        ...     def __init__(self, config: BaseEngineConfigDict):
        ...         self.config = config
        ...         
        ...     def integrate(self, shot_info, max_range, **kwargs):
        ...         # Implementation here
        ...         pass
        ...         
        ...     def zero_angle(self, shot_info, distance):
        ...         # Implementation here  
        ...         pass
    
    >>> # Runtime type checking
    >>> engine = MyEngine(config)
    >>> isinstance(engine, EngineProtocol)
    True

    Algorithm Details:
        Different engine implementations may employ various computational strategies:
        
        Integration Methods:
        - Runge-Kutta 4th order (RK4): High accuracy with moderate computational cost
        - Euler methods: Fast computation with lower accuracy
        - Adaptive step-size: Dynamic precision adjustment for optimal performance
        
        Zero-Finding Algorithms:
        - Bisection method: Robust convergence with guaranteed bounds
        - Newton-Raphson: Fast convergence when derivatives are available
        - Secant method: Faster but no guarantee of convergence

    See Also:
        py_ballisticcalc.engines.base_engine.BaseIntegrationEngine: Base implementation
        py_ballisticcalc.interface.Calculator: Uses EngineProtocol implementations
        py_ballisticcalc.trajectory_data: Data structures for trajectory results

    Note:
        This protocol uses structural subtyping (duck typing) which means any class
        that implements the required methods will be considered compatible, even if
        it doesn't explicitly inherit from EngineProtocol. The @runtime_checkable
        decorator enables isinstance() checks at runtime.

        This method integrates the projectile's equations of motion to generate
        a complete trajectory from muzzle to the specified maximum range, accounting
        for gravitational acceleration, atmospheric drag, and environmental conditions.
        
        Args:
            shot_info: Complete shot configuration containing projectile data,
                      environmental conditions, sight configuration, and firing
                      parameters. Must include muzzle velocity, ballistic coefficient,

                      continues until the projectile reaches this range or impacts the ground.
            dist_step: Distance interval between trajectory data points. If None,
                      engine uses default step size for optimal accuracy/performance balance.
            time_step: Time interval for integration steps. Zero means engine

            filter_flags: Trajectory flags to control which data points are included

        Returns:
            HitResult: Complete trajectory calculation parameters and results.
        
        Raises:

            RuntimeError: If the numerical integration fails to converge.
            OutOfRangeError: If the requested max_range exceeds computational limits.
        
        Note:
            The integration method should handle edge cases such as very steep
            firing angles, extreme environmental conditions, and projectiles
            with unusual ballistic characteristics. Results should be physically
            reasonable and mathematically consistent.

        Mathematical Background:
            The integration solves the vector differential equation for projectil
            motion under the influence of gravity and atmospheric drag:
            
            dV/dt = D * |V| * (V - W) - g

            Where:
            - V = (v_x, v_y, v_z) is velocity relative to the ground
            - W = (w_x, w_y, w_z) is wind velocity vector relative to the ground
            - D = drag factor, which is a function of velocity, atmosphere, and
                    projectile characteristics that include shape and mass
            - g is gravitational acceleration

        Algorithm Details:
            Typical implementation steps:
            1. Initialize state vectors from shot_info parameters
            2. Set up integration bounds and step size parameters
            3. Begin numerical integration loop using chosen method
            4. At each step, calculate drag forces from atmospheric conditions
            5. Update position and velocity using integration formulae
            6. Check termination conditions (range limit, ground impact)
            7. Store trajectory points at specified intervals

            OutOfRangeError: If the target distance exceeds maximum effective range.
        
        Note:
            This method returns the lower of the two ballistic solutions hit a target point.
            To get the higher ("lofted") solution we have been adding a .find_zero_angle()
            method that offers a `lofted: bool` parameter to select between the two.

        Mathematical Background:
            The method solves the equation f(θ) = 0 where:
            f(θ) = y(target_distance, θ) - target_height
            
            Where y(x, θ) is the trajectory height function at distance x for
            launch angle θ. This requires iterative solution since the trajectory
            equation cannot be solved analytically for arbitrary drag functions.

        Algorithm Details:
            Typical implementation approach:
            1. Establish reasonable bounds for elevation angle search
            2. Define target function: trajectory_height(distance) - target_height
            3. Use root-finding algorithm (bisection, Newton, etc.)
            4. For each iteration, calculate trajectory to target distance
            5. Evaluate height difference at target distance
            6. Adjust angle estimate based on convergence strategy
            7. Continue until convergence tolerance is met
            8. Return final angle estimate
